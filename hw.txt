Yahoo Analysis:
Based on the comparison of Yahoo and Google search results for 100 queries, Yahoo's results showed 
limited similarity to Google's. The average percent overlap between Yahoo and Google was 13.4%, 
meaning that only about 1.3 out of every 10 results were shared between the two search engines for 
a typical query. The average Spearman coefficient was -2.57, indicating that when Yahoo and Google 
did share results, they often ranked them in different or even opposite orders. The negative Spearman 
coefficient suggests that Yahoo frequently disagrees with Google on the relative importance of shared 
results, with many queries showing strongly negative coefficients (as low as -36.0). Overall, Yahoo 
performed worse than Google as a baseline, demonstrating both low overlap in results and significant 
disagreement in ranking when results were shared.

Bonus Analysis:
Just for fun I also ran the scripts on DuckDuckGo and Ask.com as well. DuckDuckGo achieved an average 
percent overlap of 11.1% with Google and an average Spearman coefficient of -4.14, indicating that when 
results did overlap, they were often ranked in significantly different or opposite orders. Notably, 
several queries showed strongly negative Spearman coefficients (as low as -67.0), suggesting DuckDuckGo 
frequently inverts Google's ranking priorities. In stark contrast, Ask.com showed 0% overlap and 0.0 
Spearman coefficient across all 100 queries, meaning not a single URL matched between Ask.com and Google. 
This complete divergence makes Ask.com the most distinct search engine tested, suggesting it either uses 
entirely different web crawling strategies, indexes different websites, or applies fundamentally different 
relevance algorithms than Google.
